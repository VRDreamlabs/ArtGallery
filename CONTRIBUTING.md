There are several ways to contribute to this project:

1) work with Lisa adding content to the gallery
2) work on creating "hallway experiences" - ways to make it fun to climb from one exhibit to another
3) help to create "gallery templates" that we can give other artists that want to put their art in our VR gallery
4) User testing of VR museum
5) Help us build our 3-d lightbox for scanning
